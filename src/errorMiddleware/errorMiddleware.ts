/**
 * Catches errors thrown from downstream middleware, as specified here:
 *
 * https://github.com/koajs/koa/wiki/Error-Handling#catching-downstream-errors
 *
 * This tries to extract a numeric error `status` to serve as the response
 * status, and will set the error message as the response body for non-5xx
 * statuses. It works well with Koa's built-in `ctx.throw`.
 *
 * This should be placed high up the middleware chain so that errors from lower
 * middleware are handled. It also serves to set the correct `ctx.status` for
 * middleware that emit logs or metrics containing the response status. For
 * this reason, we recommend a sequence like:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * app
 *   .use(requestLoggingMiddleware)
 *   .use(metricsMiddleware)
 *   .use(ErrorMiddleware.handle)
 *   .use(allTheRest);
 * ```
