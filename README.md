## Introduction

Koala is a collection of Koa add-ons intended to make it easy to follow common SEEK conventions around tracing, logging and metrics.
Refer to the [Koala manifesto](CONTRIBUTING.md) for philosophy behind Koala.

```shell
yarn add seek-koala
```

## Included Add-Ons

- **[AsyncMiddleware](./src/asyncMiddleware/README.md)** facilitates lazy loading of an asynchronously-initialised middleware.

- **[MetricsMiddleware](./src/metricsMiddleware/README.md)** uses [hot-shots](https://github.com/brightcove/hot-shots) to record Datadog metrics about requests and their response codes.

- **[RequestLogging](./src/requestLogging/README.md)** facilitates logging information about requests and responses.

- **[SecureHeaders](./src/secureHeaders/README.md)** attaches response headers that opt-in to stricter browser security policies.

- **[TracingHeaders](./src/tracingHeaders/README.md)** deals with [RFC002 request tracing](https://github.com/SEEK-Jobs/rfc/blob/master/RFC002-RequestIds.md) and `User-Agent` headers.

- **[VersionMiddleware](./src/versionMiddleware/README.md)** attaches app version information to outgoing responses.
